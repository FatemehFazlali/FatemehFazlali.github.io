  abstract={Flipped learning is a relatively new approach in teaching in which the place of teacher's lecture in the classroom and the students’ assignments are exchanged to enhance active learning, engagement and achievement. Flipped learning can be applied for the professional development of pre-service and in-service teachers as well. This study investigated the effect of flipped professional development on the achievement of novice EFL teachers. For this purpose, 150 teachers were selected through purposive sampling from different language institutes and non-profit complexes such as Roshangar and Tazkieh in Tehran, district 2. The teachers were divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental group was supposed to attend the flipped classroom whereas the control group attended traditional lecturebased classroom (equal N= 75). Based on the teachers’ needs the course of" Classroom Management" was selected.“Farhangyada” which is a learning management system was employed to load content of the course for the experimental group. An instructor taught the content of the course for the control group in the traditional way for 6 weeks. To collect data, pre-test and post-test were conducted. Results achieved from the pre-test and post-test indicated that teachers in flipped professional development performed better than teachers in traditional professional development class.},
